## Changing the constitution

Rules to change the constitution are defined in [section 6.2](./constitution.md#62-changes-to-the-constitution).

In short:
- The *general rocket circle (GRC)* has the authority to change the constitution.
- However, a change accepted by the *GRC* does not automatically become valid. It must be shared with all crew members, which should all accept or raise an objection. The change is valid when there is no objections.

The *interpreter* of the *GRC* is responsible for applying valid constitution changes.

Other files than `constitution.md` and the images included in it are not part of the constitution and may be changed without going through the process described in [section 6.2](./constitution.md#62-changes-to-the-constitution).
